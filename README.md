# What is this?

This repository is about **design pattern**,(based on the DRAGON BOOK of design pattern) which demonstrates many good ways to write your code, especially when you corporates with others.
However, you should not just focus on the concrete implements, but **the thought of object-oriented programming.**

# Why read this?

Of course you could read the DRAGON BOOK directly, but I want to summarize the thought of OOP by myself, and try to make is **AS EASY AS POSSIBLE**, in that case,  you would have a nice feeling when learning it.

# How read this?

This is about the structure. We have 3 parts: **Creational Pattern, Structural Pattern and Behavioral Pattern**. Each pattern would have **include and src(source).** Include contains a lot of .h files, most of whom make the declaration of a class, while src contains a lot of .cpp files, most of whom implement methods declared in .h file with the same filename.

There is an entity file in include and src. Entity file contains many classes that are **NOT SO IMPORTANT** . They are merely some classes to make the code **more readable** (for example, In Abstract Factory Pattern ,I want to create a Maze, that makes it more readable).

For each pattern, there is a related file with the same filename with the pattern. In the file, a **README.md** is included, and that is of **GREAT IMPORTANCE,** you must read it before you see the code, and after you see the code you must read it.

Since I am a sophomore, of course I will make a lot of mistakes, so if you guys find those mistakes, please tell me and give me some suggestions!
