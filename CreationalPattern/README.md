# Some guidance:

1. In creational pattern, all specific patterns have **COMMON entities**, they are all in entity file.
2. include/MazeGame.h and src/MazeGame.cpp will show you how there patterns come into work.
3. You should build and run, which will make it more vivid to learn.(But main.cpp is not finished yet, so this would not be a good choice now!)
